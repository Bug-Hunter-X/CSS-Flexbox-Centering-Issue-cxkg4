The following CSS rule is intended to center a div element both horizontally and vertically within its parent container. However, it does not work correctly in all browsers. 
```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```
The issue lies in that `height: 200px` is explicitly set to the div; the parent element is needed to be set in order for the div to be centered within it.
